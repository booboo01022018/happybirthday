            <h1>Boo! (September 14, 2024)</h1>
            <p>The day I started writing this was on August 13th, while riding the Metro-North train on the way to the Sylvanus company outing. I started listening to Beautiful Day by U2. I listened to this song the entire time I waited for you in LIC when I got the offer from Chronosphere. In essence, I decided to take the feeling from that day and be happy.</p>
            <p>You're the purpose for everything I do. Every meal I prepare for us, I want it to be a pleasurable experience for us. Me going at it as hard as I could during the job search was easy because I had someone to do it for. The sense of duty to a higher mission, beyond myself, propelled me through the hardships of achievement. I had no choice because I wanted to create the best possible life for ourselves in the States and future for us when we are in Taiwan. Or if I looked at it as a choice, I chose to see it as a unique gift to be the best possible version of myself for you.</p>
            <p>My hope is as we continue to move forward is to have more experiences with each other and enjoy each other as my life settles down and stabilizes, and we finish the marathon. To be able to discover a place we can call our happy home and to travel together.</p>
            <p>Love,</p>
            <p><strong>Tree</strong></p>
